  The effects of the Arctic oscillation over the North Pacific, he said, are more subtle.
  In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
  While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting.
  They also adhere firmly to their long-held opinion that any future warming will be inconsequential or modest at most, and that its effects will largely be beneficial.
  With the National Research Council panel's conclusion that the surface warming is real, ``one of the key arguments of the contrarians has evaporated,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist with Environmental Defense, formerly the Environmental Defense Fund.
  One whose views have evolved is Wallace, who describes himself as ``more skeptical than most people'' but ``fairly open to arguments on both sides'' of the debate.
  But many skeptics, including Gray and Singer, maintain that the warming of the past 25 years can be explained by natural causes, most likely changes in the circulation of heat-bearing ocean waters.
  They said that the changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of global warming.
  The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
  The two alternating states have markedly different effects on weather.
  The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects of global warming on El Nino's frequency.
  Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
  These effects open up a new way of tracking the progress of global warming without the uncertainties in simple temperature measurements.
  Computer models of the effects of warming point to the appearance of jets of fast-moving wind between the troposphere and stratosphere, roughly 12 kilometers above the Earth's surface.
However, methane and nitrous oxide are more powerful in retention of heat and thus potential causes for global warming, Eurostat said.
