  They established a working group to investigate how to secure funds for malaria control plans and made recommendations on key areas in malaria prevention, treatment and control, according to the statement.
  The Yunnan Institute of Malaria Prevention, China's only malaria research organ of its kind, established in 1957, has been running classes in the past 40 years and has trained more than 2,000 personnel in malaria prevention and treatment.
  PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Since there is no vaccine against malaria, prevention depends on two important measures: taking a drug that combats the parasite prophylactically _ that is, in advance of any known infection _ and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito.
  "In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease," it said, adding that research and development in malaria prevention and treatment have made advances.
  Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides.
  The key features of the implementation of the initiative will be early treatment of malaria cases, promotion of the use of insecticide-impregnated nets, prevention and strengthening of the capacities of countries and communities to combat the disease, according to the statement.
  So far, Malarone has been approved for both prevention and treatment in Denmark only, and is approved solely for treatment in Britain, although physicians there report giving it to travelers as a protective measure, too.
  The ministers from South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe said in a statement that an coordinated approach was essential to contain the spread of malaria.
  He said many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa overstretched their resources to provide prevention and treatment services on malaria related illness.
  It suggested the following actions: -- Give full political support to actions directed towards sustainable malaria preventioan and control as an urgent priority; -- Further develop and implement plans for malaria prevention and control, including incorporation into development projects based on environmental and health impact assessments; -- Develop strong community based programs to mobilize active community participation for malaria prevention and control; -- Promote and support micro-financing schemes, especially for women, to initiate income generating projects aimed at basic environmental and household improvements; -- Develop mechanisms that will facilitate and ensure well coordinated multisectoral action to reduce substantially the burden of malaria and promote inter-country collaboration and coordination of efforts; and -- Promote basic and operational research to ensure that new tools, including vaccines, are made available without delay and existing ones are used in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner.
  However, the study says that the discovery could assist medical practitioners to adequately treat infant babies who presented vague symptoms of malaria.
 Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides.
  It combines two medications: atovaquone, used to treat lung infections in immune-compromised patients, and proguanil, an old malaria therapy.
  "This research will definitely lead to improvement in the tools for diagnosis and treatment of malaria and its prevention," he said.
 The statement said the working group was charged to investigate: -- the prediction of unexpected climatic conditions that may adversely influence the incidence of malaria; -- the harmonization of treatment and prophylaxis protocols, vector control and the use of insecticides, taking into account the national scientific evidence and prevailing circumstances; -- developing clear guidelines on the rational use of malaria prophylaxis and treatment during pregnancy; -- examining and developing strategies to manage the effect of cross- border movements; -- the impact of the movement of people on the spread, management and reporting of the disease, and -- examining the extent of private sector influence on drug resistance.
