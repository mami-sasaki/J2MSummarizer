  ``Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right around the time of diagnosis,'' she says.
  The findings, reported Wednesday at a San Diego meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, could lead to better treatment for patients and new ways to prevent the disorders, Harris said.
  ``One of our concerns is the research seems to point to certain minimum number of hours (of treatment to be successful,)'' said Nellie Allnutt, social services coordinator of the Developmental Disabilities Division, King County.
  For families, treatment is the most pressing concern.
  After a long and contentious hearing in Congress Thursday, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House Government Reform committee, who agreed on little else, agreed to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to set up an extensive, impartial study of whether vaccination may cause a small number of causes of autism.
  A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society of America, ``2000 National Conference on Autism: Celebrating Our Future,'' is focusing on treatment options, research and the incidence of autism.
  No one knows what the cause of autism is. The situation has gotten so acute that a group of 30 local families has banded together to lobby for improved services and persuaded Children's Hospital to begin a program specializing in pediatric autism.
  In addition to lobbying for more research funding, the Cure Autism Now Foundation also has established a gene bank of ``multiplex'' families with more than one autistic child to help speed the identification of genes associated with autism.
 A: Current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain, but no specific cause.
  But it is not yet clear if the reports reflect higher incidence of the condition or better diagnosis and the availability of better treatment.
  ''I think this (study) is going to bring more and more attention to autism and the fact that it's not a rare disorder, that we need more attention to diagnosis,'' so affected children can get treatment earlier and reach a higher level of function, said Dr. Audrey Mars, an assistant pediatrics professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey who examined many of the children.
  When news broke a few months ago that Seattle would become one of two places in the country doing federally funded research on an experimental treatment for autism, the researchers were deluged with calls.
  The group joins other established parent organizations, such as FEAT (Families for Effective Autism Treatment), which are also working to increase training, awareness and funding for autism therapy.
  ) AUTISM-CURE (Undated) _ When news broke a few months ago that Seattle would become one of two places in the country doing federally funded research on an experimental treatment for autism, the researchers were deluged with calls.
 The CDC found 60 children ages 3 to 10 who had autism or autism-related disorders, said Jacquelyn Bertrand, a developmental psychologist at the CDC.
