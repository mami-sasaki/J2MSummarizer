  Some diplomats accuse the United States of also withholding information because its scientists did not find VX components or precursor chemicals on its second batch of samples, so as not to put its first tests into question.
  Although the United States struck at the Shifa plant, officials in Washington acknowledged that the second plant is also suspected of making chemical weapons.
  But both countries have ratified the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which requires complete destruction of all such stockpiles.
 He said evidence suggests that bin Laden was seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, for use against American targets.
  A senior administration official said that Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier, has been working with the Islamic militant government in Sudan since 1995 to develop and buy dual use equipment that can be used to produce VX and other weapons of mass destruction.
  U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction _ and the missiles to deliver them _ before the 15-member Security Council will lift the sanctions.
  It seemed possible that the pharmaceutical factory was not actually making the ``precursor chemical'' that the administration described, the diplomats here said.
  In all, eight incinerators, including the Tooele facility, are to be used for the weapons destruction.
  Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference Thursday that the administration had bombed the Shifa Chemical Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan because the intelligence community was ``confident'' that the plant was ``involved in the production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor chemicals for deadly V-series of nerve agents, like, for example, VX.
  Iraq has acknowledged that it once had sufficient precursor chemicals to make nearly 500 tons of VX, but claims that all its VX stocks have been destroyed.
  In a press release, Human Rights Watch said it wanted an international investigation ``to bring justice to the victims, strengthen international controls over the proliferation of chemical weapons and prevent a dangerous arms race in the former Yugoslavia.
  The administration has been extremely reluctant to discuss Yugoslavia's ability to develop, produce and stockpile chemical weapons and other unconventional arms, or, as they are sometimes called, weapons of mass destruction.
 '' Jonathan Tucker, director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons nonproliferation project at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said that there were three likely possibilities for those agents: the main precursors phosphorous trichloride or phosphorous pentasulfide, both of which are used in the production of certain pesticides, and another important ingredient, diisopropyl ethylamine.
  Although the administration says the precursor has no other use than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical weapons, said another administration official, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
  Amy E. Smithson of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an arms research organization in Washington, said it would not take a large amount of precursor chemicals _ or space _ to make a weapon.
 Pentagon officials said they had no evidence that Yugoslavia was making or testing biological weapons.
