 Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
  Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina -- a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino's -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
  El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
  La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west.
  The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance.
  Although the current La Nina conditions are following on the heels of last winter's El Nino, they often occur years apart and don't alternate in an orderly progression.
  With no El Nino or La Nina, there is no sheep dog driving the sheep, no strong organizing force giving shape to the otherwise chaotic flow of weather across the seas and continents.
  Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on South African weather, and that earlier forecasts for dry conditions from November to March were correct.
  "If we can predict a change in the weather, such as when El Nino cycles around, we could have all the interventions in place before the weather changes.
  ``Weak La Nina conditions'' have started to develop, the World Meteorological Organization said in its El Nino/La Nina Update.
  ``El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time,'' said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate Prediction Center.
  ``It's really a question at this point: Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers? La Nina is linked to cooler conditions in central North America, and dry, warm conditions in the southern states.
  La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
 By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
