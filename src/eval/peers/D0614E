  Canada's federal government has asked the court to rule on three subjects: -- Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence under domestic law? Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
  Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum.
  OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
  Unlike past developments on Quebec separation, which sent financial markets spiraling downward, the projected results appeared to have been discounted already.
  The election results keep the independence movement alive, but it is wounded.
  While the rest of Canada considers this a crucial election, even the staunchest Quebec separatists concede that some passion has gone out of the secession movement.
  In a 1995 referendum on independence, the restive province of Quebec came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging Canada into its darkest political hour in decades.
  QUEBEC _ Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province, possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest of Canada, and possibly another referendum on independence.

  After 30 years of the separatist movement, many Quebecers have developed sophisticated positions on independence that at times can puzzle outsiders.
  For Canada is getting tough on Quebec just as polls show the sovereignty movement going nowhere.
  The holiday is celebrated mainly by Quebec's French-speaking nationalists _ those who support either outright independence from Canada or some form of increased autonomy.
 The modern separatist movement began about 30 years ago and is based on deeply rooted feelings that Quebec has not been treated fairly by English speaking Canada.
