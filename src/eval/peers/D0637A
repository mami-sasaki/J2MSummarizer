  The team consisted of United Nations Development Program official in charge of global environment facility Steve Hirch, Chairman of all solar companies in Uganda John Semanda, and the principal energy officer in the Mministry of Natural Resources Livingstone Bangi.
  It carries out extensive solar research and development at a number of universities and institutions at desert to provide substantial amounts of solar-derived power.
  These projets were all put forward by various governments at the request of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in the past three years and decided by the World Solar Commission.
  Professor Xia Laifeng from Yunnan Teachers' University, the solar energy research base in the province, said that they are studying the possibility of building "solar energy houses," which use solar energy for heating and air conditioning, and are decorated with solar energy equipment.
  The development of the two energy resources will add to the traditional and predominant power generation means through oil and hydro resources in meeting an ever-increasing energy need, which is growing at 12 to 14 percent yearly, said Minister of Electricity and Energy Osman Abaza.
  The first group of proposals includes forming a Sino-Israeli center to expand the use of solar energy in the region, and developing an energy-efficient solar water heater, which would be especially suited to sunny north China.
  He said Zimbabwe's solar energy development infrastructure is at an advanced stage.
  Visiting Israeli Director of Energy Resources Management Department in the Ministry of National Infrastructure Joseph Nowarski said solar and renewable energy offers great potential for economic cooperation between Israel and Zimbabwe.
  The banner has become a model area in the region in the development of solar energy.
  YAOUNDE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The two-day seminar on solar energy ended here this evening after discussing how to develop and apply solar energy in the rural areas in Africa.
  Chinese energy experts attending the summit said the program on solar energy is the most important document in the development and use of renewable energy sources in the next 10 years.
 During his stay, Nowarski is scheduled to meet officials from the Zimbabwean Ministry of Transport and Energy Wednesday to discuss possible areas of cooperation.
  Australia is leading the world in a number of areas of solar energy research and application.
  The program says the World Solar Commission, which drew up the program, will accomplish these projects through mobilizing a concerted global effort with the continued cooperation and commitment of various governments, international organizations, bilateral and multilateral funding institutions, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, research organizations and universities.
 The project has a large solar receiver which operates over an area of 540 square meters and can provide 100 kilowatts of heating or cooling capacity.
