  The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct.
  WASHINGTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir pilot seeking asylum in England who says he has information about October's deadly crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 will be interviewed by U.S. accident investigators.
  CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Pilots Association chief Walid Murad demanded on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash interview pilots who said they saw a shooting fireball near the crash site.
  WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public release of reports compiling the facts in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last fall off the New England coast.
  ``There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
  Because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed, there has been speculation that may have been what happened on Flight 990.
  Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
  CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian pilots have demanded the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hand over the probe into the 1999 EgyptAir plane crash to a third party if it fails to release key evidence, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported on Tuesday.
 But they do not single out a particular cause of the crash and do not include any analysis.
  All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
  NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ A submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday, bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
  If there is evidence of a crime in the plane crash, the investigation authority will be shifted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under U.S. rules.
  That speculation was fueled because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed in flight.
  The captain, who submitted his report to the airlines two weeks after the EgyptAir crash, said his plane had the same flight path clearance as the EgyptAir plane.
 Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew fight or pilot suicide.
