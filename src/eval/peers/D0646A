  Republicans had called the hearing to emphasize that perjury is an important crime.
  They point out that perjury is a highly technical crime that requires such an airtight case that prosecutors rarely pursue it. ``It's a crime of words,'' said Brosnahan, who has both prosecuted and defended people in perjury cases.
  ``Perjury, regardless of the setting, is a serious offense that results in incalculable harm to the functioning and integrity of the legal system as well as to private individuals.

  James E. Rogan, R-Pasadena, used statistics as a weapon against President Clinton on Friday, calling on his experience as a prosecutor and judge to show punishment for perjury is not nearly a rarity.
  Rory Little, a professor at Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and a former associate deputy attorney general under Janet Reno, regards the possibility of perjury before the grand jury as a far more serious offense.

 WHAT IS THE REPUBLICANS' ARGUMENT ON THE PERJURY CHARGES? They say Clinton perjured himself by playing word games with the definition of ``sexual relations.
