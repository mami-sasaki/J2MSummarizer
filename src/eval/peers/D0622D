  The discovery last summer that West Nile had arrived in New York City, coupled with confirmation this month that the virus is circulating locally in at least four states, has triggered an extraordinary national effort to track the microbe.
  ``It's important to note that all the control measures in New York and surrounding states are appropriate whether St. Louis or West Nile-like virus is involved,'' Skinner said.
  Although there have been no reports of human infections so far this year, ''we have to redouble our efforts, because now is the time when you would see any human cases,'' said Dr. Steven Ostroff, a West Nile authority at the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the United States until August; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
  Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and Europe, never before in the United States.
  PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) - Centers for Disease Control officials left New Jersey on Wednesday to await the results of tests on mosquitoes and sparrows in four northern counties that could show how far west the West Nile virus has spread.
  This will be the case in the United States for years to come, scientists suggest.
  The publicity about the West Nile virus and counties' intensified mosquito control efforts have prompted more residents to call about dead crows they have found, which has led to more testing, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
  They warn that the Gulf coast of the United States will probably see the next outbreak of West Nile virus.
  ATLANTA _ Georgia and other states on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts may not be prepared for a resurgence of West Nile virus, the imported illness that infected 61 and killed seven in the Northeast last fall and may have spread south with migrating birds, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Thursday.
  A critical one is that the CDC can no longer be certain that the West Nile virus has never been present in the United States, because federal scientists never specifically checked for it in earlier outbreaks and individual cases.
  Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying now under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus.
  Schuber said the county has spent $1.15 million on West Nile prevention efforts this year and last year lent its trucks to New York City to help spraying efforts there.
  HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- An 82-year-old New Jersey man has become the first person in the United States this year to die of the West Nile virus, Gov.
 The West Nile virus -- never before recorded in the Western Hemisphere -- probably entered the United States in infected birds.
