  Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages.
  Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair growth.
  In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids.
  Such side-effects of anabolic steroids have been generally known since 1977, they said.
  Nor did the study conclude whether the supplement has long-term side effects.
  During his testimony, Kipke admitted that he had distributed anabolic steroids to the swimmers but contended that he was unaware that the drugs carried any adverse side effects other than a deepening of the voice.
  Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had thought they were were reversible.
  He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed had harmful side effects.
  ``There's no long-term study done on creatine, so you have no information from 10 years out,'' Olsen said.
  NEW YORK _ In 1970, two years into the open-tennis era and two years before Title IX, a pair of relatively obscure female players walked around the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills with a questionnaire.
 Side effects include stunted growth for young people, increased aggressiveness, and lower levels of ``good'' cholesterol, which could increase risk of heart disease.
  ``If you get a symptom such as kidney failure 15 years down the road, how do you relate that back to their creatine use? .
  Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels, Leder noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects.
  Prosecutors say the 20 female athletes involved in the case suffered serious side-effects from the drugs, and that Ewald and Hoeppner knew of the potential danger.
 Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage.
