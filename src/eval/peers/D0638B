  Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
  Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
  LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
  Flight controllers did not dare send Galileo into the blizzard of Jovian radiation surrounding Io, the innermost of the major moons, until all other mission objectives had been accomplished.
  Otherwise, Galileo's agenda is not clear, pending a NASA decision on whether to go ahead with a full 14-month extension called the Galileo Millennium Mission.
  The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled.
  It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway through a $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and other moons.
  Kivelson said that if the full Galileo mission extension was approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this same type of phenomenon occurred on Ganymede, which is the largest moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet Mercury.
  Galileo's other studies will include a search for auroral activity on Jupiter's nightside and observations of other Jovian moons, such as Io, Europa and Callisto.
  The data was collected in December 1995 when a probe set loose from the Galileo spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, plunged into the planet's atmosphere.
 The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
  It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway through an $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and other moons.

  LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
 A report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the planet with extraterrestrial life.
