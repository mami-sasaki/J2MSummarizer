  Those are pretty sophisticated devices.
  Convinced of the recorders' benefits, James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, last month called for the devices on cars, trains, buses and ships.
  ``Unfortunately, in the past kids have been just an afterthought in terms of the design of safety features for an automobile,'' he said.
  The board has placed the devices on its new ``most-wanted list'' of safety improvements.
  Auto parts stores sell anti-theft devices for drivers' air bags, which attach to the steering wheel or special bolts that make it more difficult for a thief to remove the safety device.
  It has decided to build large scale simulation facilities to carry out collision tests and promote the production of automobile safety systems.
  As the automotive industry watchdog, MMBI has issued a set of regulations governing automobile safety in the last couple of years.
  LOS ANGELES -- The evacuation of an apartment complex Friday because of an unexploded, stolen air bag reveals what police say is a thriving, illegal trade in these car safety devices.
  The use of such devices is favored by doctors, engineers and government officials.
  ``It is a very, very exciting time in automobile safety,'' Augenstein said.
  ``It's time for the automobile manufacturers to put kids first in the design of their vehicles, and to focus on the back seat where kids sit most of the time,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
  Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers rejected that argument.
 Some researchers view the black box as a way to improve automobile safety.
  The impetus to record this information to aid crash investigators came from the National Transportation Safety Board, which recommended in 1997 that automakers develop onboard collision-sensing and -recording devices.
 The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents.
